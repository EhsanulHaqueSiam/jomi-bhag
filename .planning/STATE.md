# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** Accurate, unbiased Islamic inheritance division -- the app strictly follows Faraid rules for every calculation without favoring any heir.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 complete. Ready for Phase 3: Core Results Display

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Heir Input Wizard) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (all done)
Status: Phase complete, ready for Phase 3
Last activity: 2026-03-12 -- Completed Plan 02-03 (Step content components, visual verification)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 0.9 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 4/4 | 31 min | 8 min |
| 2 | 3/3 | 36 min | 12 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-04 (1 min), 02-01 (8 min), 02-02 (3 min), 02-03 (25 min)
- Trend: Steady

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Used vitest/config defineConfig for merged Vite+Vitest types in single config file
- HeirType modeled as 17-value string union (not enum) covering complete Hanafi taxonomy
- Rule table conditions ordered most-specific-first for deterministic evaluation
- Umariyyatayn handled as engine-level special case (ONE_THIRD default in rule table)
- MFLO Section 4 stance: pure Faraid default, MFLO as opt-in toggle (from CONTEXT.md)
- Rules 2/4 (deeper grandson blocking) not modeled: HeirType stops at son_of_son level
- Rule 5 exception: daughter_of_son not blocked when son_of_son present (Asaba bi-ghayrihi)
- Pipeline enforcement: blocking -> shares -> special cases -> adjustments
- Umariyyatayn detection uses post-blocking state (siblings blocked by father don't prevent it)
- Asaba priority: son(1) > son_of_son(2) > father(3) > grandfather(4) > brother_full(5) > brother_consanguine(6)
- Awl uses BigInt LCM for exact common denominator computation
- Radd Bait-ul-Maal: only-spouse remainder NOT redistributed, noted as public treasury
- FaraidInput extended with predeceasedChildren for MFLO without breaking existing API
- Engine converts fard_and_asaba to fard in final ShareResult output
- Import cleanup: removed unused FaraidRule type, Fraction default imports, and unused fraction constants to unblock tsc build
- deriveDeceasedGender: husband->female, wife->male (user IS the heir type role)
- Auto-includes tracked as separate array, recalculated on relationship/userGender/motherAlive change
- buildFaraidInput merges auto-includes with manual counts additively via Map
- completedSteps stored as number[] (not Set) for Zustand serialization
- CSS @import order: font imports before tailwindcss import to avoid warnings
- Gold palette added as custom oklch values; emerald uses TailwindCSS 4 built-in
- [Phase 02]: Tooltip uses useState + click-outside listener (no external positioning library)
- [Phase 02]: StepIndicator reads from useWizardStore directly (no props), per anti-prop-drilling pattern
- [Phase 02]: AppLayout uses inline SVG data URI for Islamic geometric pattern at 3% opacity
- [Phase 02]: WizardShell direction state tracked locally (useState), not in Zustand store
- [Phase 02]: Mobile nav uses fixed bottom bar with pb-24 spacing on main content
- [Phase 02]: FamilyTree SVG visualization added as interactive relationship selector alongside grid buttons
- [Phase 02]: Sibling progressive disclosure defaults changes to fullCount only when collapsed
- [Phase 02]: Auto-include badges show '(includes you)' next to relevant steppers

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Mouza rate data: No public API exists. Gazette PDFs may be extractable but not yet validated. Affects Phase 5.
- Bengali PDF rendering: @react-pdf/renderer conjunct character shaping not validated. English-only for v1 but font architecture matters.
